Using Alexa to controll IOT devices on the HSU campus

This works by using a AWS queue to controll clicks on a computer. The computer clicks on a debug aplication for controlling a projector.

Going into the future we wish to replace the computer with the debug app with a rasbery pie talking directly to a projector or device via USB, Serial, or over the network.
